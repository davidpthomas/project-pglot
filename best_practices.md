## Best Practices for the Project

### Imports
- Group imports into three categories: standard library, third-party libraries, and local application imports.
- Use absolute imports for clarity and to avoid confusion with modules of the same name in different packages.

```python
import os
import random

from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render

from myapp.utils import my_function
```

### Exception Handling
- Use specific exceptions from the `gunicorn.http.errors` module for handling HTTP-related errors.
- Define custom exceptions for application-specific error handling.
- Log exceptions using the project's logging mechanism before raising or handling them.

```python
from gunicorn.http.errors import InvalidRequestLine

try:
    # some code that might raise an exception
except InvalidRequestLine as e:
    logger.error("Invalid request line: %s", e)
    raise
```

### Logging
- Use the logging module for all logging purposes.
- Configure logging settings in a centralized location, such as a configuration file.
- Use different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) appropriately.

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
```

### Configuration
- Store configuration settings in a separate configuration file.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information and override default settings.
- Use the `Config` class from `gunicorn.config` for managing configuration settings.

```python
from gunicorn.config import Config

cfg = Config()
cfg.set('bind', 'unix:/tmp/bar/baz')
cfg.set('workers', 3)
```

### HTTP Requests
- Use the `RequestParser` from `gunicorn.http.parser` for parsing HTTP requests.
- Validate request data thoroughly and handle invalid data gracefully.

```python
from gunicorn.http.parser import RequestParser

parser = RequestParser()
try:
    request = parser.parse_request_line(data)
except InvalidRequestLine:
    logger.error("Invalid request line")
```

### Documentation
- Document all public classes and methods with docstrings.
- Include parameter descriptions, return values, and examples where applicable.

```python
def match_readline(self, req, body, sizes):
    """
    Reads and validates lines from the request body against the expected body content.

    Args:
        req: The request object containing the body to read from.
        body: The expected body content to match against.
        sizes: A callable that returns the size of data to read.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the data read does not match the expected content.
    """
    # implementation
```

### Testing
- Use the `unittest` framework for writing and organizing tests.
- Mock external dependencies to isolate the unit under test.
- Ensure 100% test coverage for critical modules.

```python
import unittest
from unittest import mock

class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    @mock.patch('myapp.module.external_dependency')
    def test_function(self, mock_dependency):
        mock_dependency.return_value = 'mocked value'
        result = my_function()
        self.assertEqual(result, 'expected value')
```

### HTML Templates
- Use Django's template language for rendering HTML templates.
- Extend base templates and use blocks for content customization.

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
<p>{{ content }}</p>
{% endblock %}
```

### File Organization
- Organize code into modules and packages based on functionality.
- Follow a consistent naming convention for files and directories.

### Security
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use HTTPS for secure communication between clients and servers.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

### Performance
- Use caching mechanisms to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
- Optimize database queries to reduce load times and resource usage.

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code style guidelines.
- Use meaningful variable and function names for clarity and maintainability.

### Version Control
- Use Git for version control and maintain a clear commit history.
- Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes, and merge them into the main branch after review.

### Deployment
- Automate deployment processes using tools like Docker and CI/CD pipelines.
- Maintain separate environments for development, testing, and production.

### Monitoring
- Implement monitoring and alerting for application health and performance.
- Use tools like statsD for collecting and analyzing metrics.

### Error Reporting
- Implement a centralized error reporting system to track and resolve issues.
- Use unique identifiers for error logs to facilitate debugging and tracing.

### Code Reviews
- Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.
- Provide constructive feedback and encourage collaboration among team members.
